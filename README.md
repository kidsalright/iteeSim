For trainin my OOP and SOLID skills i've coded this game.
Atm it works, but it could be much more interesting, i had
a lot of ideas to make game great..

But im tired of perspectiveless coding,
hire me please, i wanna have a job heh)))

Firstly, u need gem 'Curses', (im usin' it to hide cursor only)
so after cloning rep use:

gem install curses


Then, just run:

ruby engine.rb


And ofc it works only with UNIX systems (because of ANSII escape sequences
that move cursor, idk how to do it on windows, and i dont wana know it)

So, after running game u have to CLICK for gaining money...
More pc's - more $$$ for click
More employees - more passive $$$
But the limit is 10 pc's, so maximum is [10/10]...
